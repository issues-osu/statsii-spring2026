# Course Objectives

This course will push you to think creatively about statistics in the social work context, exploring regression, measurement, and latent variable models with an emphasis on real-world application. Each week will involve hands-on learning, storytelling through data, and team-based projects. By the end, you'll not only master regression techniques but also apply them to innovative social work challenges.
