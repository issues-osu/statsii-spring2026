# Week 7: February 24, 2026

## Reading

-   Diez et al. Chapter 9: Logistic Regression, from pp 371; sec. 9.5
-   See resources

## Introduction to the Topic

This week, we focus on **logistic regression**, a statistical method used to model binary outcomes and predict probabilities. Logistic regression is a cornerstone technique in statistical modeling, particularly for research questions involving categorical dependent variables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Concepts:

-   **Logistic Regression Models**: Analyze the relationship between independent variables and a binary dependent variable (e.g., success vs. failure).
-   **Odds Ratios**: Interpret the effect of predictors on the likelihood of the outcome.
-   **Model Fit and Diagnostics**: Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of logistic regression models.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Relevance:

-   Students will learn how to build logistic regression models and interpret their results, including coefficients, odds ratios, and predicted probabilities.
-   Students will explore model evaluation techniques, such as goodness-of-fit measures and ROC curves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Is Important:

-   Logistic regression is widely used in various fields, including social sciences, medicine, and marketing, to answer questions about classification and prediction.
-   Understanding logistic regression provides the foundation for advanced modeling techniques like multinomial and ordinal regression.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How This Ties Into the Overall Course:

-   Builds upon previous weeks' focus on linear regression and effect sizes, extending these concepts to binary outcomes.
-   Prepares students for upcoming topics like machine learning classification models and survival analysis, where logistic regression plays a foundational role.

By the end of this week, students will be able to confidently apply logistic regression to real-world problems, interpret model outputs, and evaluate model performance for binary classification tasks.
