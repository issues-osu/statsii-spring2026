Dataset: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)

The data for this study were drawn from the Kentucky Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a state-based surveillance system that collects data on maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. The dataset used in this study, "KSPRAMS_SUB_WEIGHT_ANALYSIS.csv," included key variables such as maternal smoking during the first trimester (CIG_1TRI), history of abuse (Any_Abuse), Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs_Scale), perinatal depression (BPG_DEPRS8), and race/ethnicity (Race_Ethnicity). To ensure data integrity, cases with missing values were omitted, resulting in a final analytical sample of 5,172 participants.

Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal smoking during the first trimester and key psychosocial risk factors, including a history of abuse, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and perinatal depression. Additionally, we sought to examine racial/ethnic differences in smoking behavior and the potential moderating role of race/ethnicity on the identified associations.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were generated to summarize the characteristics of the sample. Linear regression models were constructed to estimate the association between smoking during the first trimester (dependent variable) and key independent variables, adjusting for potential confounders. Dummy variables were created for race/ethnicity categories (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, and Other) using the fastDummies package in R. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was computed to assess multicollinearity.

Model 0 examined the bivariate association between Any_Abuse and CIG_1TRI. Model 1 added ACEs_Scale to the regression, and Model 2 incorporated BPG_DEPRS8. Finally, Model 3 included race/ethnicity as a categorical predictor to test for potential racial/ethnic disparities in smoking behavior. The performance of the models was evaluated using R-squared values, adjusted R-squared values, and F-statistics.

To verify the assumptions of linear regression, diagnostic plots were generated, including residual plots for linearity and homogeneity of variance, an influential observations plot, a variance inflation factor (VIF) assessment, and a normality of residuals plot. The performance package in R was used to check for heteroscedasticity and normality violations, and the emmeans package was employed for post-hoc comparisons of estimated marginal means.

Results

Significant findings revealed that a history of abuse was associated with a 2.29-unit increase in smoking during the first trimester (B = 2.29, p < 0.001) in Model 0. In Model 1, both Any_Abuse (B = 1.85, p < 0.001) and ACEs_Scale (B = 0.44, p < 0.001) remained significant predictors, with an increase in adverse childhood experiences associated with higher smoking likelihood. A one standard deviation increase in ACEs_Scale (1.41 points) was associated with a 0.62-unit increase in smoking, while an interquartile range (IQR) increase (2 points) was associated with an increase of 0.89 units. Model 2 further demonstrated that perinatal depression (BPG_DEPRS8) was a significant predictor of smoking (B = 1.04, p < 0.001), indicating that maternal depression during pregnancy increased the likelihood of smoking. Specifically, mothers with perinatal depression smoked an average of 1.04 more cigarettes per day compared to those without depression. Similarly, mothers with a history of abuse smoked an average of 1.85 more cigarettes per day compared to those without a history of abuse.

In Model 3, race/ethnicity was included to assess disparities in smoking behavior. Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic mothers exhibited significantly lower smoking rates (B = -0.93, p < 0.001), while Non-Hispanic Black and Other racial groups did not significantly differ from Non-Hispanic Whites. Post-hoc comparisons of estimated marginal means confirmed that Hispanic mothers had the lowest estimated smoking rates (M = 1.23, 95% CI [0.91, 1.54]), whereas Non-Hispanic Whites had the highest (M = 2.16, 95% CI [1.96, 2.36]).

Diagnostics revealed a violation of the normality assumption, as indicated by the non-normality of residuals (p < 0.001). Heteroscedasticity was detected (p < 0.001), suggesting non-constant error variance. However, no multicollinearity issues were present, as all VIF values were below 5. Outlier analysis showed no extreme influential observations affecting model estimates.

Conclusion

This study highlights the significant role of psychosocial risk factors in predicting maternal smoking behavior during pregnancy. A history of abuse, adverse childhood experiences, and perinatal depression were robust predictors of smoking, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. Racial/ethnic disparities were observed, with Hispanic mothers exhibiting lower smoking rates compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. These findings underscore the importance of integrating mental health and trauma-informed care into prenatal smoking cessation programs.
