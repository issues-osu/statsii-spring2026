### Optional Reading

#### Redlining, Reverse Redlining and its Modern Day Impact

I have written or co-authored several papers demonstrating that historical redlining, a 1930s federal practice that assigned risk grades to neighborhoods based largely on racial composition, continues to serve as a critical analytical framework for understanding modern-day structural inequalities across multiple sectors. In the context of child welfare, research utilizes these historical maps to show that neighborhoods with poorer Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) grades experience significantly higher rates of child protective services reports, illustrating how racist housing policies have created distressed environments where families lack the necessary resources for wellbeing (@littletonHistoricalRedliningNeighborhood2024b).

Furthermore, redlining trajectories—which combine historic maps with contemporary lending data—have been applied to medical research to demonstrate that structural racism modifies the efficacy of health interventions (@wingTrajectoryLongitudinalLending2025). For instance, a skills-based intervention for stroke survivors was found to be least effective in areas categorized by declining investment, suggesting that neighborhood contexts shaped by persistent discrimination can impede individual health recovery efforts (@wingTrajectoryLongitudinalLending2025).

Finally, spatial analyses of redlining are used to link housing discrimination to public health crises such as gun violence; neighborhoods facing "sustained disinvestment" (both historical redlining and modern predatory lending) are at a significantly higher risk for firearm-related homicides, reinforcing Ruth Gillmore's concept of "organized abandonment" where resources are systematically withdrawn from communities of color (@barboza-salernoRedliningReinvestmentRacial2025c).

Collectively, previous research suggests that redlining is not merely a historical artifact but a foundational cause of present-day disparities, necessitating multisector policy reforms to address these long-term structural inequities

#### Exploring the relationships between self-care and well-being outcomes among child welfare professionals

The study by Clark et al. (2025) analyzes baseline survey data to examine the relationship between self-care and well-being among child welfare professionals (@clarkExploringRelationshipsSelfcare2025). Conducted in a Midwestern state, the study was embedded within a larger five-year federally funded research collaborative involving one public agency and five private providers. The researchers utilized an online survey platform (REDCap) to collect data in November 2020 from a final analytical sample of 305 direct service and supervisor professionals, representing a 23.3% response rate from the 1,308 individuals originally invited via email.

To operationalize workforce well-being, the methodology employed the Professional Quality of Life (ProQol) measure. This instrument consists of three 10-item subscales used as the study’s primary dependent variables: Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS) (α = 0.88), Burnout (α = 0.71), and Compassion Satisfaction (α = 0.89). Each item was rated on a five-point frequency scale, with researchers verifying that the data did not severely deviate from normality through skewness and kurtosis assessments.

The independent variables focused on two dimensions of self-care: frequency and variety. The number of self-care activities was measured using an eight-item index developed in consultation with a professional steering committee, covering physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains (e.g., exercise, sleep, spending time with family). The frequency of self-care was captured through a single item asking participants how often they intentionally practiced these behaviors, with responses ranging from "Never" to "At least daily". Statistical analysis was conducted in three phases using Stata 17.0. First, univariate analyses established descriptive profiles of the sample. Second, simple linear regressions tested the direct associations between self-care and well-being. Finally, multivariate linear regressions were performed to control for various covariates, including years of experience, education level, geographic region, agency role, licensure status, race/ethnicity, and gender. To ensure the integrity of the results, the researchers implemented Little’s test, which confirmed that missing data (ranging from 0% to 12.13%) were Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). Consequently, they utilized the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) approach to reduce estimate and standard error biases. For the multivariate models, effect sizes were reported using Cohen’s $f^2$, categorized as small (≥ 0.02), medium (≥ 0.15), or large (≥ 0.35). Participants who identified as "outliers" were assessed but ultimately retained because their removal did not substantially alter the study’s findings

## Simple Linear Regression – Introduction to the Topic

This week, we will delve into **Simple Linear Regression**, a foundational tool in statistical analysis that allows us to model relationships between two variables. Students will learn how to interpret the slope, intercept, and residuals, and use regression output to draw meaningful conclusions about data. Through this process, students will develop a deeper understanding of how regression can be used to predict outcomes and test hypotheses in social work research.

In this unit we will learn to quantify the relationship between two numerical variables, as well as modeling numerical response variables using a numerical or categorical explanatory variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What will students learn this week?

-   The fundamental components of a simple linear regression model (slope, intercept, and residuals).
-   How to interpret regression output, including unstandardized and standardized coefficients.
-   The practical steps to fit a simple linear regression model in R using `lm()`.
-   How to visualize regression results and residuals using `ggplot2`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why is this topic important?

Simple Linear Regression serves as the building block for more advanced statistical methods, such as multiple regression, moderation, and mediation analysis. It allows social work researchers to identify relationships between variables, predict outcomes, and inform data-driven decision-making. Mastering this concept is essential for understanding more complex techniques later in the course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How does it relate to previous or future content?

-   **Ties to previous content**: Builds upon last week's review of descriptive statistics and introduces the concept of relationships between variables.
-   **Prepares for future topics**: Provides a foundation for upcoming topics like [multiple regression](03-multiple-regression.qmd), where we will expand from one predictor to multiple predictors, and [interaction effects](07-moderation.qmd), where regression will be used to explore moderating relationships.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This session emphasizes the practical and theoretical importance of regression analysis, helping students connect statistical techniques to real-world social work applications.
