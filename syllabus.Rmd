# Syllabus: Statistics for Social Justice

## Course Information

**Course Title**: Statistics II: Equity-Focused Data Analysis\
**Instructor**: Dr. Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno\
**Institution**: College of Social Work, The Ohio State University\
**Term**: Spring 2025

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Course Description

This course empowers students to use advanced statistical tools to address social inequities. By combining data analysis with critical thinking, students will learn to analyze inequities focusing on topics such as child welfare, education, health, housing, and criminal justice, while fostering equitable research practices.

Stats II for Social Workers focuses on two topics that are central to social science research: multiple regression and the development of measures or scales. Introductory to intermediate regression topics will be covered, such as mediation, moderation, dummy variables in regression, and hierarchical regression. Scale development procedures from generating items to conducting exploratory factor analysis will be covered. The course will emphasize the application of skills and knowledge for conducting analyses in SPSS and Stata, as well as interpreting and reporting results. However, it is important to have a wide variety of tools at your disposal for the problem at hand. Therefore, I will introduce several open-source tools that will facilitate some of the analyses we will conduct. Practical issues, such as managing missing data and violations of assumptions will be covered. The course will prepare students to conduct power analyses and to generate and interpret confidence intervals. Content in the course will refer back to content in the theory and research methods courses in the CSW PhD curriculum.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Specific Course Goals

At the conclusion of the course, students will have skills and knowledge to independently conduct regression analyses to answer research questions and test hypotheses. They will also understand the centrality of measurement in quantitative research and will be familiar with the process of scale development. The course will begin with a review of important ideas from Stats I for Social Workers: the strengths and limitations of quantitative analyses, the role of theory in testing hypotheses, ethical issues in quantitative research, the nature of inferential statistics, and the concept of variance. Specifically, by the end of the course students will:

1.  Understand the purposes and mechanics of linear and multiple regression;
2.  Understand how regression analysis relates to correlations/covariances, t Tests, and ANOVAs;
3.  Have skills to independently conduct linear, multiple, and hierarchical regression analyses (i.e., linear regression & logistic regression) in SPSS and Stata;
4.  Have skills to conduct mediation tests in regression using SPSS and Stata, and interpret their results statistically and in relation to hypotheses;
5.  Have skills to conduct moderation tests in regression using SPSS and Stata, and interpret their results statistically and in relation to hypotheses;
6.  Have skills to appropriately code dummy variables, use them in regression analyses, and interpret their coefficients;
7.  Be able to compute and interpret confidence intervals and effect sizes in regression analyses;
8.  Be familiar with a sequence of qualitative and quantitative procedures in scale development, including literature review, item generation, cognitive testing, pilot-testing, and exploratory factor analysis;
9.  Understand the concept of measurement validation as an ongoing, multifaceted process with the end goal of evaluating the appropriateness and ethics of interpreting scores in practice;
10. Understand the concept and be able to compute multiple types of scale reliability;
11. Understand when and how to use multiple imputation to address missing values in a dataset;
12. Have skills to interpret and conduct power analyses for multiple regression.
