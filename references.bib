  abstract = {Objective To examine associations between parent health literacy, discharge plan complexity, and parent comprehension of and adherence to inpatient discharge instructions. Study design This was a prospective cohort study of English/Spanish-speaking parents (n~=~165) of children {$\leq$}12~years discharged on {$\geq$}1 daily medication from an urban, public hospital. Outcome variables were parent comprehension (survey) of and adherence (survey, in-person dosing assessment, chart review) to discharge instructions. Predictor variables included low parent health literacy (Newest Vital Sign score 0-3) and plan complexity. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for the assessment of multiple types of comprehension and adherence errors for each subject, adjusting for ethnicity, language, child age, length of stay, and chronic disease status. Similar analyses were performed to assess for mediation and moderation. Results Error rates were highest for comprehension of medication side effects (50\%), adherence to medication dose (34\%), and return precaution (78\%) instructions. Comprehension errors were associated with adherence errors (aOR, 8.7; 95\% CI, 5.9-12.9). Discharge plan complexity was associated with comprehension (aOR, 7.0; 95\% CI, 5.4-9.1) and adherence (aOR, 5.5; 95\% CI, 4.0-7.6) errors. Low health literacy was indirectly associated with adherence errors through comprehension errors. The association between plan complexity and comprehension errors was greater in parents with low (aOR, 8.3; 95\% CI, 6.2-11.2) compared with adequate (aOR, 3.8; 95\% CI, 2.2-6.5) health literacy (interaction term P~=~.004). Conclusions Parent health literacy and discharge plan complexity play key roles in comprehension and adherence errors. Future work will focus on the development of health literacy-informed interventions to promote discharge plan comprehension.},

This paper is intended as an applied protocol to help students understand the data, select the most appropriate models, verify assumptions, and interpret the output. Basic ecological questions are tackled using data from a fictional series, ?Fantastic beasts and where to find them,? with the aim to show how statistical thinking can foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in ecology, from the formulation of hypotheses to the interpretation of results.},

  abstract = {Child maltreatment is a critical public health problem whose structural underpinnings underscore the need to move prevention efforts from individual-level risk factors to social policy. Despite previous studies exploring the evolution of child maltreatment risk in socially vulnerable contexts, little is known about how neighborhood level material deprivation and job market characteristics, beyond the employment context, impact substantiated maltreatment risk. The present analysis integrates multiple streams of data to explore the complexity of child maltreatment in the most populous county in New Mexico as a case-study. A geospatial model was used to produce posterior risk estimates and exceedance probabilities of substantiated child maltreatment derived from administrative records controlling for financial strength, economic inequality and hardship, educational attainment, housing and food insecurity and labor market characteristics. Findings showed that over the nine-year study period, the average relative risk of child maltreatment increased substantially, however, there was substantial regional and temporal heterogeneity. More specifically, substantiated child maltreatment risk became more highly concentrated into the most deprived 20\% of neighborhoods over time. The results showed a very strong area deprivation effect such that: (1) the risk of maltreatment in the most deprived 20\% of neighborhoods on financial strength was 130.78\% higher compared to the least deprived 20\% of neighborhoods; and (2) maltreatment rates in the bottom 20\% of neighborhoods on economic inequality and hardship were 40.52\% higher compared to the least deprived 20\% of neighborhoods. Finally, substantiated child maltreatment was significantly associated with multiple labor market characteristics including commuting times to work, origin--destination job flows, and mode of transportation to work. From a policy perspective, the results of this study support structural interventions aimed at reducing neighborhood-level material hardship and labor market disadvantage as avenues to support parents so that children and families can thrive.},

The current study examined latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms using data from 3,819 respondents of the Adolescent Health Survey. Four trajectory profiles of depressive symptoms were identified: low-stable, high-decreasing, low-increasing, and moderate-decreasing. A broad array of risk factors were included into the modeling procedure to identify predictors of group membership. Relative to the low-stable group, membership in one of the three symptomatic groups (i.e., heightened depressive symptoms) was predicted by poverty, low self-esteem, gender, drinking frequency, poor academic outcomes, delinquency, and child maltreatment type. This study contributes to our understanding about the longitudinal manifestations of depression and identifies a broad array of factors significantly related to pathways of resilience.},

Most of the literature examining the relationship between child physical abuse (CPA) and adult violence has focused narrowly on academic outcomes rather than taking a broader view that explores the processes undergirding school engagement and connections. The present study adopted Connell?s model of school engagement, connectedness and outcomes within a social bond framework to examine (a) the link between CPA and school social bonds, (b) the link between CPA and adult violence persistence, and (c) the mediational (parallel, serial) effects of school bonds (engagement, connection, and achievement) on violence perpetration in adulthood. Consistent with previous research, results indicated that children who experience physical abuse have poorer academic performance, which, in turn, is related to future violent trajectories. We further found that the relationship between CPA and violence persistence is mediated by a process of bonding to school that begins with being actively engaged in school activities and ends with higher levels of academic achievement. In particular, some of the ?school achievement? effect found in previous research operates through behavioral and emotional manifestations and may be partly explained through physically abused children?s lessened ability to be engaged with and connected to school activities. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications stemming from our findings.},
