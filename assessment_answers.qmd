## PART I

### **1. Introduction to Data**

#### Question:

Using the table below, calculate:

1. The proportion of youth with PTSD in the treatment group by the end of the first year.
2. The proportion of youth with PTSD in the control group by the end of the first year.

| Group      | PTSD (0-30 days) | No PTSD (0-30 days) | PTSD (0-365 days) | No PTSD (0-365 days) |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Treatment  | 33               | 191                 | 45                | 179                  |
| Control    | 13               | 214                 | 28                | 199                  |

#### Answer:

1. **Proportion of PTSD in the treatment group**:

   $$
   \text{Proportion} = \frac{\text{PTSD cases}}{\text{Total cases}} = \frac{33 + 45}{33 + 191 + 45 + 179} = \frac{78}{448} \approx 0.174 \,(17.4\%)
   $$

2. **Proportion of PTSD in the control group**:

   $$
   \text{Proportion} = \frac{\text{PTSD cases}}{\text{Total cases}} = \frac{13 + 28}{13 + 214 + 28 + 199} = \frac{41}{454} \approx 0.0903 \,(9.03\%)
   $$

#### Interpretation:

The treatment group had a PTSD rate of 17.4%, while the control group had a lower PTSD rate of 9.03%. This suggests that factors associated with treatment may influence PTSD rates, which warrants further investigation.

### **2. Relationships Between Variables**

#### Question:

True or False: Variables cannot be both associated and independent.

#### Answer:

**False.**
If two variables are associated, they are not independent. Association implies a relationship between variables, whereas independence means no influence of one variable on another.

---

### **3. Interquartile Range (IQR)**

#### Question:

1. Define Q1 (25th percentile) in words.
2. If Q3 = 300 and Q1 = 100, calculate the IQR.
3. Why do extreme observations affect standard deviation more than the IQR?

#### Answer:

1. **Definition of Q1**: Q1 is the value below which 25% of the data lies. It represents the first quartile of the dataset.

2. **Calculate IQR**:

   $$
   \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 = 300 - 100 = 200
   $$

3. **Effect of extreme observations**:

   Extreme values (outliers) have a larger impact on the standard deviation because it measures the average squared deviation of all data points from the mean. In contrast, the IQR focuses only on the middle 50% of the data, ignoring extremes.

### **4. Contingency Table**

| Response  | None  | Small | Big   | Total |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Yes**   | 0.406 | 0.458 | 0.136 | 1.0   |
| **No**    | 0.113 | 0.748 | 0.139 | 1.0   |

#### Question:

1. What does 0.458 represent?
2. What does 0.139 (No, Big) represent?

#### Answer:

1. **Interpretation of 0.458**:
   0.458 represents the proportion of participants who answered "Yes" and experienced a "Small" response.

2. **Interpretation of 0.139**:
   0.139 represents the proportion of participants who answered "No" and experienced a "Big" response.

### **5. Probability Distributions**

#### Question:

Which of the following salary distributions is valid? Identify errors in the others.

| Income Range (\$1000s) | 0-25 | 25-50 | 50-100 | 100+ |
|-------------------------|------|-------|--------|------|
| **A**                  | 0.18 | 0.39  | 0.33   | 0.16 |
| **B**                  | 0.38 | -0.27 | 0.52   | 0.37 |
| **C**                  | 0.28 | 0.27  | 0.29   | 0.16 |

#### Answer:

- **Correct Distribution: C**
  - Total = $0.28 + 0.27 + 0.29 + 0.16 = 1.00$, and all probabilities are valid (0 ≤ p ≤ 1).
- **Errors in Others**:
  - **A**: Total = $0.18 + 0.39 + 0.33 + 0.16 = 1.06$, which exceeds 1.
  - **B**: Contains a negative probability ($-0.27$), which is invalid.

#### Interpretation:

Distribution C is valid because it adheres to the fundamental rules of probabilities, where all probabilities are between 0 and 1, and their sum equals 1.

### **6. Independent Random Variables**

#### Question:

1. What is the probability that both people develop PTSD?
2. What is the probability that neither does?
3. What does independence mean, and why does this assumption matter?

#### Answer:

1. **Probability both develop PTSD**:
   $$
   P(\text{PTSD}) = 0.09
   $$
   $$
   P(\text{Both}) = 0.09 \times 0.09 = 0.0081 \,(0.81\%)
   $$

2. **Probability neither develops PTSD**:
   $$
   P(\text{No PTSD}) = 1 - 0.09 = 0.91
   $$
   $$
   P(\text{Neither}) = 0.91 \times 0.91 = 0.8281 \,(82.81\%)
   $$

3. **Independence Definition**:

   Independence means the outcome of one event does not influence the outcome of another. This assumption is critical because the joint probability calculations (e.g., $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$) rely on it.

### **7. COVID-19 Table**

#### Question:

Using the following table:

| Vaccinated | Yes    | No     |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Lived      | 0.0382 | 0.8252 |
| Died       | 0.0010 | 0.1356 |

1. Calculate the probability a randomly selected person who was not vaccinated died from COVID.
2. Use a tree diagram to calculate:
   - The probability a random person was vaccinated and lived.
   - The probability a random person died (regardless of vaccination status).

#### Answer:

1. **Probability a not-vaccinated person died**:
   $$
   P(\text{Died | Not Vaccinated}) = 0.1356
   $$

2. **Tree Diagram Calculations**:

   - **Probability a person was vaccinated and lived**:
     $$
     P(\text{Vaccinated and Lived}) = P(\text{Vaccinated}) \cdot P(\text{Lived | Vaccinated}) = 0.0382
     $$

   - **Probability a person died (regardless of vaccination status)**:
     $$
     P(\text{Died}) = P(\text{Vaccinated}) \cdot P(\text{Died | Vaccinated}) + P(\text{Not Vaccinated}) \cdot P(\text{Died | Not Vaccinated}) = 0.1366 \,(13.66\%)
     $$

#### Interpretation:

The overall risk of death (13.66%) is dominated by unvaccinated individuals, highlighting the critical importance of vaccination in preventing COVID-19 deaths.

### **8. Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation**

#### Question:

Compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation for the following probability distribution:

| $i$ | $x_i$ | $P(X = x_i)$ | $x_i \times P(X = x_i)$ |
|-----|-------|--------------|-------------------------|
| 1   | 0     | 0.2          | 0                       |
| 2   | 137   | 0.55         | 75.35                   |
| 3   | 170   | 0.25         | 42.5                    |

#### Answer:

1.  **Mean**:\
    $$
    \mu = \sum x_i \cdot P(X = x_i) = 0 + 75.35 + 42.5 = 117.85
    $$

2.  **Variance**:\
    First, calculate squared deviations:\
    $$
    \sigma^2 = \sum P(X = x_i) \cdot (x_i - \mu)^2
    $$ For each $x_i$:

    -   $(0 - 117.85)^2 = 13895.62$
    -   $(137 - 117.85)^2 = 364.52$
    -   $(170 - 117.85)^2 = 2635.92$

    Weighted sum: $$
    \sigma^2 = 0.2 \cdot 13895.62 + 0.55 \cdot 364.52 + 0.25 \cdot 2635.92 \approx 4004.5
    $$

3.  **Standard Deviation**:\
    $$
    \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{4004.5} \approx 63.31
    $$

#### Interpretation:

The data shows a mean value of 117.85 with a standard deviation of 63.31, indicating moderate variability around the mean.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **9. Normal Distribution**

#### Question:

Let $X \sim N(\mu = 3, \sigma = 2)$, and observe $x = 5.19$.\
1. Compute the Z-score of $x$.\
2. Determine how many standard deviations $x$ is from the mean.

#### Answer:

1.  **Z-score**:\
    $$
    Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{5.19 - 3}{2} = \frac{2.19}{2} = 1.095
    $$

2.  **Standard deviations from the mean**:\
    The Z-score $Z = 1.095$ indicates $x = 5.19$ is **1.095 standard deviations above the mean**.

#### Interpretation:

A Z-score of 1.095 means the observed value is moderately above the average in the normal distribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **10. Social Work Licensing Exam**

#### Question:

The licensing exam follows $N(\mu = 92.6, \sigma = 3.6)$.\
1. Compute the Z-score for a score of 95.4.\
2. Compute the Z-score for a score of 85.8.\
3. Which score is more unusual?\
4. Calculate and interpret percentiles for these scores.

#### Answer:

1.  **Z-score for 95.4**:\
    $$
    Z = \frac{95.4 - 92.6}{3.6} = \frac{2.8}{3.6} = 0.778
    $$

2.  **Z-score for 85.8**:\
    $$
    Z = \frac{85.8 - 92.6}{3.6} = \frac{-6.8}{3.6} = -1.889
    $$

3.  **More unusual score**:\
    $Z = -1.889$ for 85.8 is farther from the mean than $Z = 0.778$, making it more unusual.

4.  **Percentiles**:\
    Using the Z-table:

    -   For $Z = 0.778$, percentile ≈ **78.1%**.\
    -   For $Z = -1.889$, percentile ≈ **3.0%**.

#### Interpretation:

A score of 95.4 is above average, placing the student in the 78th percentile. In contrast, a score of 85.8 is far below the mean, placing the student in the 3rd percentile. This highlights significant performance differences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **11. SAT Scores**

#### Question:

The SAT follows $N(\mu = 1500, \sigma = 300)$.\
1. What is the probability of scoring at least 1630?\
2. How does it affect the calculation if 75% of test-takers scored above 1600?\
3. Discuss the social justice implications of interpreting aptitude statistically.

#### Answer:

1.  **Probability of** $X \geq 1630$:\
    Compute Z-score:\
    $$
    Z = \frac{1630 - 1500}{300} = \frac{130}{300} = 0.433
    $$ Using the Z-table, $P(Z \geq 0.433) = 1 - 0.6664 = 0.3336 \, (33.36\%)$.

2.  **If 75% scored above 1600**:\
    This would indicate a shift in the distribution, suggesting the mean or variance has changed. A new analysis is required.

3.  **Social justice implications**:\
    Interpreting aptitude purely statistically can reinforce systemic inequities (e.g., access to resources, cultural biases). Statistical aptitude measures must consider broader socio-economic contexts.
