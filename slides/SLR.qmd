# Slide 2: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)?
- title: "What is Simple Linear Regression?"
- content: |
    **Definition:**  
    Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between two variables: one dependent (response) variable and one independent (predictor) variable.  

    **Key Idea:**  
    SLR estimates a linear equation (Ž̂ = β0 + β1X) that predicts the dependent variable (Ž) based on the independent variable (X).

# Slide 3: What is SLR Useful For?
- title: "What is SLR Useful For?"
- content: |
    **Applications:**  
    - Predicting outcomes (e.g., predicting sales from advertising spend).  
    - Understanding relationships (e.g., relationship between study hours and test scores).  
    - Quantifying the impact of one variable on another.  

    **Why It Matters:**  
    SLR is foundational for more complex modeling techniques.

# Slide 4: Types of Data Needed
- title: "Types of Data Needed"
- content: |
    **Requirements for Data:**  
    - Dependent Variable (Ž): Continuous (e.g., height, income).  
    - Independent Variable (X): Can be continuous or categorical (e.g., age, treatment group).

    **Note:** Assumptions (e.g., normality, homoscedasticity) will be covered in another lecture.

# Slide 5: Statistical and Conceptual Model
- title: "Statistical and Conceptual Model"
- content: |
    **Statistical Model:**  
    Ž = β0 + β1X + ε  
    - β0 (Intercept): Predicted value of Ž when X = 0.  
    - β1 (Slope): Change in Ž for a one-unit change in X.  
    - ε (Error Term): Represents variability not explained by X.  

    **Conceptual Model:**  
    Focuses on understanding the direction and strength of the relationship.

# Slide 6: Interpreting the Coefficients
- title: "Interpreting the Coefficients"
- content: |
    **Intercept (β0):** The expected value of Ž when X = 0.  

    **Slope (β1):** For each one-unit increase in X, Ž changes by β1 units.

# Slide 7: Examples
- title: "Examples"
- content: |
    **Example 1:** Predicting test scores from study hours.  
    - β0: Predicted score when study hours = 0.  
    - β1: Increase in score per additional hour.  

    **Example 2:** Estimating house prices from square footage.  
    - β0: Predicted price when square footage = 0.  
    - β1: Increase in price per square foot.

# Slide 8: Mean Centering
- title: "Mean Centering"
- content: |
    **What is Mean Centering?** Subtracting the mean of X from each value to create a centered variable.  

    **Why Do It?**  
    - Changes the intercept to represent Ž at average X.  
    - Does not change slope or model fit.  

    **Comparison:**  
    - Without Centering: Intercept at X = 0.  
    - With Centering: Intercept at mean(X).

# Slide 9: How to Perform SLR in R
- title: "How to Perform SLR in R"
- content: |
    **R Packages:**  
    - `lm()` for modeling.  
    - `ggplot2` for visualization.  
    - `car` for diagnostics.  

    **Example Code:**  
    ```R
    library(ggplot2)
    data <- data.frame(X = 1:5, Y = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10))
    model <- lm(Y ~ X, data)
    summary(model)
    ggplot(data, aes(X, Y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
    ```

- content: |
    **Key Takeaways:**  
    - SLR quantifies relationships.  
    - Interpret intercept (β0) and slope (β1).  
    - Mean centering changes intercept interpretation.  
    - Use R tools for easy implementation.
