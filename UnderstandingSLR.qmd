## What We Are Doing Today

Today we are going to **build a prediction equation together** using real housing data that you collected **in class**.

We are **not** calculating regression coefficients yet.  
We are learning **what a regression equation is trying to say**.

By the end of this exercise, you should understand:

- What a predicted value ($\hat{y}$) represents  
- How an equation encodes a prediction rule  
- Why predictions can be wrong even when they seem reasonable  

---

## Step 1: Collecting Housing Data (In Class)

Each student is assigned **one U.S. state** from a group of states that share the same first letter.

Each student will:

1. Go to a [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_content=1471764169|65545421228|kwd-570802407|603457706088|&semQue=null&utm_campaign=zxw_br_natip_usa_x_nat_x_e_g_1&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=1471764169&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-NHLBhDSARIsAIhe9X3kFyS7iWTrPNH7wUhF3HEktu4YdxgRVPrhYKjyY0swcHiRMmVarHgaAsT7EALw_wcB)
2. Choose **10 homes** from their assigned state (filter = Homes)
3. Record **only** the following into the shared Excel [spreadsheet](https://buckeyemailosu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/barboza-salerno_1_osu_edu/IQAABJu3h5r6QZiGL1V4QJKdAZ4Qea5QdZ7mZqqztgQh53A?e=wIj5yS):
   - Square footage (sq ft)
   - Sale or listing price (USD)
   - State abbreviation

Do **not** record:

- Number of bedrooms
- Neighborhood
- Year built
- Any other features

---

## Step 2: Entering Data into the Shared Spreadsheet

Each student enters their 10 homes into the **shared class spreadsheet** using the provided template.

Each row represents **one home**.

| State | Square Footage (sq ft) | Price ($) |
|-------|------------------------|-----------|
| XX    | XXXX                   | XXXXX     |


---

## Step 3: What Are We Predicting?

Our goal for today is to predict:

> **House price**

Using **only**:

> **Square footage**

We are pretending to be a **national housing price prediction system**.

It is obvious that larger homes tend to cost more. Our goal is not to state that fact, but to be precise about it.

Specifically, we want to do two things:

1. **Quantify the change in cost** ($y$) associated with each increase in square footage ($x$).  
   In other words, as a home gets larger, how much more expensive do we expect it to be?

2. **Use that relationship to make predictions.** Given a specific square footage, we want the model to produce a predicted home price, particularlyn for homes we have not directly observed.

This is what a simple linear regression model is designed to do.

Important constraint:

> We are allowed to use **only square footage**.  
> We are *not* allowed to use state, neighborhood, or any other information.

---

## Step 4: Thinking in Terms of Change (Not Ratios)

We are **not** asking:

- “What is the price per square foot?”

Instead, we are asking:

> **“As square footage increases, how much does price tend to increase?”**

This is a question about **change**, not division.

---

## Step 5: The Class Prediction Rule (Verbal)

As a class, we agree on **one rule** that applies to **all homes**:

> **For every additional 100 square feet of house size, the predicted price increases by approximately \$XXXX.**

The value \$XXXX is chosen **by the class** based on the pooled data.

Why do we talk about **100 square feet** instead of **1 square foot**?

In theory, we could describe the change in price for every single additional square foot.  
In practice, that change would be very small and hard to interpret.

Housing prices typically change by **thousands of dollars**, not by a few dollars at a time.  
If we used 1 square foot as the unit, the number would be tiny and not very meaningful on its own.

Using 100 square feet:

- Matches the scale at which people think about home size (rooms, additions, renovations)
- Produces numbers that are easier to read, compare, and discuss
- Makes it clearer how changes in size translate into noticeable changes in price

This choice does **not** change the relationship between size and price.  
It only changes how we **describe** that relationship in words.

::: callout-note
## Why we do *not* use 1 square foot (and why this matters for storytelling)

By default, a regression model calculates change for a **1-unit increase** in the predictor.  
In this case, that means the model naturally estimates the change in price for **1 additional square foot**.

There is nothing mathematically wrong with that.

However, **1 square foot is not a meaningful unit for telling a housing story**.

For example, suppose the model estimates that price increases by:

> **$2.50 for every additional square foot**

That is a correct statement—but it sounds trivial.

Now tell the *same story* using a more meaningful unit:

- $2.50 per **1 sq ft**
- $250 per **100 sq ft**
- $2,500 per **1,000 sq ft**

All three describe the **same relationship**.  
None of them change the model.

What changes is **how clearly the story communicates real-world impact**.

This is why we choose to talk about **100 square feet**:

- It reflects how people actually think about housing size
- It turns a tiny coefficient into a meaningful narrative
- It makes the effect of size on price easier to interpret and discuss

Choosing the unit is not changing the model—it is choosing **how to tell the story of the model**.

## Step 5.5: Converting the Default 1-Unit Change into a 100-Unit Change

Regression models are built around a simple idea: **a coefficient describes the change in predicted $y$ for a 1-unit increase in $x$.**  

By default, a regression model estimates the change in price for a **1-unit increase** in square footage.

That means the model first produces a number that represents:

> **How much the predicted price changes for one additional square foot.**

We label that number using a symbol, called the coefficient for square footage, written as $b_1$.

For example, if the model estimates:

$$
b_1 = 2.50
$$

then the story is:

> **For every additional 1 square foot, the predicted price increases by \$2.50.**

But we usually want a more meaningful story unit—like **100 square feet**.

### Converting from 1 sq ft to 100 sq ft

A 100 sq ft increase is just 100 one-sq-ft increases. So:

$$
\text{Change for 100 sq ft} = 100 \times (\text{change for 1 sq ft})
$$

That means:

$$
\text{Dollars per 100 sq ft} = 100 \times b_1
$$

### Example (so you can see the difference in the story)

Suppose a model gives:

$$
b_1 = 2.50
$$

This means:

- **Per 1 sq ft**: predicted price increases by **$2.50**
- **Per 100 sq ft**: predicted price increases by:

$$
100 \times 2.50 = 250
$$

So the same relationship can be told as:

- “For every additional **1 sq ft**, price increases by **$2.50**.”  
- “For every additional **100 sq ft**, price increases by **$250**.”

These statements are mathematically identical, but the second one is usually a clearer real-world story.

### How we are using this in class today

Today, the class will choose **$XXXX per 100 sq ft** directly because it is a meaningful unit for housing.  

If we wanted to express the same rule as a “default” 1 sq ft change, we would divide by 100:

$$
\text{Dollars per 1 sq ft} = \frac{\text{XXXX}}{100}
$$

So:

- $XXXX$ per **100 sq ft** is the same as $\frac{XXXX}{100}$ per **1 sq ft**.

We are not changing the model—we are choosing a unit that helps us interpret and communicate the relationship clearly.

---

## Step 6: Writing the Prediction Equation

Now we translate the verbal rule into an equation.

This equation does **not** describe what actually happened.  
It describes how our **model makes predictions**.

The prediction equation has the form:

$$
\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1(\text{square footage})
$$

Where:

- $\hat{y}$ = predicted house price  
- $b_1$ = how much price changes as square footage increases  
- $b_0$ = a baseline price  

Using the class-chosen value, the equation becomes:

$$
\hat{y} = b_0 + (\text{XXXX per 100 sq ft}) \times \text{square footage}
$$

This is **our equation**.

## Step 7: Predicting a House We Do *Not* Observe

Now we use the equation to predict the price of a house that does **not** appear in the dataset.

### Prediction Question

**If a house is exactly 1,725 square feet, what price does our equation predict?**

Using the class equation:

$$
\hat{y}_{1725} = b_0 + (\text{XXXX per 100 sq ft}) \times 1725
$$

This predicted value is written as $\hat{y}$.

> $\hat{y}$ is the model’s **guess** for a house size we have never observed.

---

## Step 8: Comparing Predictions to Reality

For selected homes in the dataset, we:

1. Plug their square footage into the equation  
2. Compute a predicted price ($\hat{y}$)  
3. Compare it to the actual price ($y$)  

Prediction error is defined as:

$$
\text{Error} = y - \hat{y}
$$

Interpretation:

- Positive error → the model **under-valued** the home  
- Negative error → the model **over-valued** the home  

---

## Step 9: Diagnosing the Model

As a class, we ask:

- Are errors small or large?
- Are they random?
- Do errors appear to cluster by state?

We do **not** fix the model yet.

---

## Reflection

What is your response to the following questions:

1. What does square footage predict well about housing prices?
2. What important information does this equation ignore?
3. Why might one prediction equation work better in some states than others?

## What You Should Take Away from Today

By the end of today, you should understand that:

- A regression equation is a **prediction rule**
- $\hat{y}$ is a **model-based guess**
- Coefficients describe **change**, not ratios
- Error reveals missing structure, not failure

Next week, we will ask:

> **What information should be added to improve this equation?**
